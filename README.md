# scsd-Toolbox
This project is a collection of Vue frontend components intended to be used in various projects within the Space Concordia Spacecraft Division. Current components are the ones from the [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/introduction.html) library in addition to a custom navbar. We will be working on customizing and adding new components to this library to better suit the team's needs.

## View components locally
This project can be ran locally to view the components in action by running the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Import components as an npm package
You can import the components as an npm package into your own project by running the following command:
```
npm install scsd-toolbox
```

Then you can use the components into your project by adding the following line to your main.js file (a button component is used as an example):
```
import { Button } from 'scsd-toolbox'
```
