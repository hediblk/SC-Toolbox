# sc-Toolbox
This project is a collection of Vue frontend components intended to be used in various projects within the Space Concordia Spacecraft division. Current components are the ones from the [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/introduction.html) library. We will be working on customizing and adding new components to this library to better suit the team's needs.

## View components locally
This project can be ran locally to view the components in action by running the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Import components as an npm package
Coming soon...
